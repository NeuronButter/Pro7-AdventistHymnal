# Pro7-AdventistHymnal
An old script that I used to convert text files of each song in the Adventist Hymnal, and format it, ready for imports to ProPresenter. It's old, I know, it's not made the most intuitively. The script does NOT break text (of 2/3/4 lines), so you'll have to adjust your import settings on Pro7 accordingly, or use the Reflow Editor to fix them later.

## To use
Download the Adventist Hymnal in a plain text format, and put it into the directory `original`.

For a copy of the Adventist Hymnal, visit [here](https://github.com/ariseforgod/adventist_hymnal/tree/master/raw_text) for the original copy, or [here](https://github.com/NeuronButter/adventist_hymnal/tree/master/raw_text) for a backup of that folder (in case the original is deleted).
